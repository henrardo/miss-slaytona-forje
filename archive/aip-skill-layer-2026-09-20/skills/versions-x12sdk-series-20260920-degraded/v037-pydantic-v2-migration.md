name: pydantic-v2-migration
description: Behavior-preserving procedure for migrating Python codebases from Pydantic v1 to native Pydantic v2, including dependencies, pydantic-settings, validators, model configuration, inherited fields, constraints, metadata, parsing, serialization, introspection, collection, public helpers, registries, and iterative test-driven repair. Use when upgrading Pydantic or fixing import, schema, validation, parsing, collection, and test failures caused by Pydantic v2.

```yaml
purpose: >
  Migrate a Python codebase from Pydantic v1 to native Pydantic v2 while
  preserving validation, parsing, serialization, settings, schemas, public
  helpers, registries, and domain behavior. Work from complete tracebacks,
  original function bodies, repository tests, and executable checkpoints
  rather than speculative bulk rewrites. Never satisfy the task by importing
  from pydantic.v1 or another v1 compatibility namespace. Never make code
  import by deleting, emptying, bypassing, or replacing a function body with a
  no-op. Preserve every validator's substantive checks, mutations, errors, and
  return behavior. Treat Python source as Python: use True and False, never
  JSON literals true and false. Do not confuse import success, successful
  collection, a zero-looking pipeline status, a green focused test, or
  warnings-only output with completion. Completion requires production code
  to compile, nonempty test collection to succeed, focused behavior tests to
  pass, the exact untruncated full-suite command to exit zero, and the final
  diff to pass static and behavior-preservation audits. Capture real command
  exit codes without piping pytest through head, tail, tee, or grep unless
  pipefail is enabled and the pytest status is explicitly preserved. Convert
  validators according to their individual signatures and semantics: a v1
  pre root validator receives raw data, while a v2 after model validator
  normally receives and returns the model instance. Never perform a blind
  repository-wide decorator substitution. After each edited file, compile it,
  import its affected module, and run the smallest relevant test before
  editing another validator-heavy file. Continue repairing until the full
  suite passes; never stop with a progress summary, migration plan, partial
  import success, collection errors, known failing tests, or an unexecuted
  proposed tool call.

trigger_when:
  - Asked to migrate a Python codebase from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2
  - A suite fails with Pydantic import, schema, validator, settings, parsing, serialization, collection, or model-construction errors after a Pydantic v2 upgrade
  - A project still uses BaseSettings, Config, validator, root_validator, allow_reuse, __fields__, ModelField, field_info.extra, regex, parse_obj, dict, json, or other Pydantic v1 interfaces
  - Dependency metadata permits or requires Pydantic 2 but runtime behavior or tests remain written for Pydantic 1

do_not_use_when:
  - The codebase is already on native Pydantic v2 and its complete suite passes
  - The task is to upgrade a dependency other than Pydantic
  - The user explicitly requires continued Pydantic v1 compatibility rather than a native v2 migration
  - The repository only consumes external Pydantic models and contains no migration work
