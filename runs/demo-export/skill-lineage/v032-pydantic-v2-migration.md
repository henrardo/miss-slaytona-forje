name: pydantic-v2-migration
description: Migrate Python repositories from Pydantic v1 APIs and semantics to native Pydantic v2, including recovery from incomplete or malformed migrations. Use for Pydantic upgrade failures involving imports, collection, model configuration, fields, validators, constructors, aliases, optionality, defaults, schemas, serialization, forward references, type aliases, root models, fixtures, dependencies, or partially passing test suites.

```yaml
purpose: >
  Migrate a Python codebase from Pydantic v1 to native Pydantic v2 while
  preserving intended validation, construction, requiredness, defaults,
  aliases, parsing, serialization, generated schemas, recursive models,
  fixtures, public APIs, dependency metadata, and repository behavior.
  Complete the migration without redirecting production imports to
  `pydantic.v1`; without deleting, emptying, bypassing, replacing with `pass`,
  or otherwise neutralizing validators or any other function bodies merely so
  imports or tests succeed; without weakening production behavior or rewriting
  tests to accept regressions; without corrupting source through broad
  mechanical edits; and without stopping after research, inventory, planning,
  an import check, compilation, collection, focused tests, or a partially
  passing suite. Treat a run with hundreds of passing tests and clustered
  failures as an actionable semantic migration stage, not near-enough success.

trigger_when:
  - Asked to migrate a codebase from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2
  - A test suite fails with Pydantic import, field, validator, or configuration errors after a Pydantic v2 upgrade
  - Test collection fails on removed Pydantic v1 arguments, methods, symbols, or semantics
  - A repository runs under Pydantic v2 but still relies on deprecated Pydantic v1 APIs
  - A prior migration attempt left partially converted, duplicated, truncated, or syntactically malformed models
  - Models import under Pydantic v2 but constructors, fixtures, aliases, schemas, serialization, or behavioral tests fail
  - Most tests pass but shared defaults, optionality, forward references, recursive aliases, root models, or exported types still fail
  - The installed Pydantic version disagrees with dependency declarations, requirements files, or lockfiles
  - A suite reaches hundreds of passing tests but still has clustered constructor, fixture, schema, or recursive-model failures
  - Shared fixtures fail because formerly omittable Optional fields became required under Pydantic v2

do_not_use_when:
  - The codebase already uses native Pydantic v2 and its complete authoritative suite and quality gates pass
  - The task upgrades a dependency unrelated to Pydantic
  - The requested outcome is explicitly to retain Pydantic v1 rather than perform a native-v2 migration

anti_patterns:
  - Before beginning, read `references/migration-guardrails.md` and enforce every guardrail throughout the migration
